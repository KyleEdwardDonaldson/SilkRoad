# Silk Road - Regional Trading System

## Overview
A plugin that integrates with BetterShop to enable cross-regional trading via player-driven delivery contracts. Players can order items from distant regions, and transporters earn bounties by delivering goods safely across dangerous territories.

## Core Concept
- **Buyers** purchase from BetterShops in other regions (Silk Road enabled shops)
- **Contracts** are automatically created for delivery
- **Transporters** accept contracts and physically travel to deliver goods
- **Bounties** decay over time but scale with distance to encourage long journeys
- **Insurance** prevents item/money loss while requiring transporter investment

---

## BetterShop Integration

### Shop Silk Road Toggle

**Commands:**
```
/shop silkroad enable        # Enable for shop you're looking at
/shop silkroad disable       # Disable for shop you're looking at
/shop silkroad enable all    # Enable for all your shops
/shop silkroad disable all   # Disable for all your shops
/shop create buy <price> --silkroad   # Create with Silk Road enabled
/shop create sell <price> --silkroad  # Create with Silk Road enabled
```

**Mechanics:**
- Look at a shop (raycast to chest/sign) to target it for commands
- No shop ID needed - intuitive targeting
- Silk Road flag saved in shop data
- Persists across restarts

### Stock Management

**Reserved Stock System:**
- When contract accepted: items reserved (not available for local purchase)
- Shop sign/hologram shows: "Stock: 45 (3 in transit)"
- If contract cancelled/expired: reservation released
- If contract completed: stock permanently removed, earnings added to shop

**Transaction Flow:**
```
1. Contract accepted ‚Üí Reserve stock in shop
2. Transporter picks up ‚Üí Items moved to cargo (virtual)
3. Delivery complete ‚Üí Shop transaction finalized
4. Shop owner gets payment ‚Üí Can collect earnings normally
```

### API/Events for Silk Road

```java
// Events BetterShop fires
- ShopSilkRoadToggleEvent (when Silk Road enabled/disabled)
- ShopStockReserveEvent (contract accepted, stock locked)
- ShopStockReleaseEvent (contract cancelled/expired)
- ShopSilkRoadTransactionEvent (delivery completed)

// API Methods
public List<Shop> getSilkRoadShops(String regionName)
public List<Shop> getAllSilkRoadShops()
public boolean canReserveStock(Shop shop, int quantity)
public boolean reserveStock(Shop shop, int quantity, UUID contractId)
public void releaseReservation(UUID contractId)
public void completeTransaction(UUID contractId, UUID buyer)
```

---

## Contract System

### Contract Types

**Type 1: Direct Shop Purchase (Auto-Generated)**
- Buyer browses Trade Post GUI
- Sees BetterShop from another region (Silk Road enabled)
- Clicks "Purchase" ‚Üí Pays shop price
- Contract auto-created and posted to job board
- Stock reserved immediately

**Type 2: Custom Delivery Request (Future feature?)**
- Player posts "Wanted: X item" contract
- Offers payment for delivery
- Any player can fulfill (not tied to BetterShop)

### Contract Lifecycle

```
POSTED ‚Üí ACCEPTED ‚Üí IN_TRANSIT ‚Üí DELIVERED ‚Üí COMPLETED
    ‚Üì         ‚Üì          ‚Üì
CANCELLED ‚Üê CANCELLED ‚Üê EXPIRED (bounty = 0)
```

### Contract Data Model

```java
class DeliveryContract {
    // Identity
    UUID contractId;
    long createdAt;
    ContractState state;

    // Shop Integration
    UUID shopId;
    Location shopLocation;      // Where to pick up (shop chest)
    String originRegion;        // e.g., "SafeZone"

    // Delivery
    Location deliveryLocation;  // Trade Post in buyer's region
    String destinationRegion;   // e.g., "Stormlands"

    // Items & Pricing
    ItemStack item;
    int quantity;
    double shopPrice;           // What buyer paid (escrowed)

    // Bounty System
    double initialBounty;       // Starting transporter payment
    double currentBounty;       // Decaying value
    double decayRate;           // $/second
    long expiresAt;             // When bounty hits 0

    // Parties
    UUID shopOwner;
    UUID buyer;
    UUID transporter;           // null until accepted

    // Journey Tracking
    Map<String, Double> regionDistances; // Region -> blocks to travel
    int transporterLevel;       // Required level to accept
}
```

---

## Bounty & Decay System

### Bounty Calculation

```java
initialBounty = (distance-based) + (value-based)

// Distance Component (primary)
distanceComponent = Œ£ (blocks_in_region √ó region_rate)

// Region Rates (per block)
stormlands: $0.50    // High risk, high reward
middle:     $0.20    // Moderate
safe:       $0.05    // Low risk, low reward

// Value Component
valueComponent = (shopPrice √ó quantity) √ó 0.15  // 15% of item value

// No slot calculation (all cargo is 1 item regardless)
```

**Example:**
- Diamond delivery: SafeZone ‚Üí Stormlands
- Distance: 800 blocks (400 safe, 400 stormlands)
- Shop price: $500 per diamond, quantity: 2
- Calculation:
  - Distance: (400 √ó $0.05) + (400 √ó $0.50) = $20 + $200 = $220
  - Value: ($500 √ó 2) √ó 0.15 = $150
  - **Total: $370 initial bounty**

### Adaptive Decay System

**Problem:** Fixed decay rate discourages long journeys

**Solution:** Scale decay rate inversely with journey length

```java
// Decay formula
baseDecayRate = 0.10; // $/second
totalDistance = sum(regionDistances.values());

// Longer journeys decay slower
decayRate = baseDecayRate / (1 + (totalDistance / 1000.0));

// Example:
// 500 blocks:  decay = 0.10 / 1.5  = $0.067/sec  (bounty lasts ~92 min)
// 2000 blocks: decay = 0.10 / 3.0  = $0.033/sec  (bounty lasts ~187 min)
// 5000 blocks: decay = 0.10 / 6.0  = $0.017/sec  (bounty lasts ~364 min)

// Minimum duration: 10 minutes even for short trips
if (initialBounty / decayRate < 600) {
    decayRate = initialBounty / 600.0;
}
```

**Result:** Long journeys remain profitable longer, encouraging ambitious routes

### Decay Tick Rate
- Update every 5 seconds (not every second)
- Reduces server load
- Bounty display shows real-time estimate

---

## Insurance System

### Transporter Insurance

**Purpose:** Prevent abuse, create economic sink, add realism

**Mechanics:**
- Transporters pay insurance upfront to accept contract
- Insurance cost: 10% of initial bounty
- Paid to transporter's home region/nation treasury (Towny integration)
- If delivery successful: transporter gets full bounty
- If contract fails (expired): insurance NOT refunded
- Insurance ensures commitment to delivery

**Example:**
- Contract bounty: $370
- Insurance cost: $37
- Transporter pays $37 to their nation
- On success: earns $370 (net +$333)
- On failure: loses $37

### Insurance Payment Flow

```java
void acceptContract(Player transporter, Contract contract) {
    double insurance = contract.initialBounty * 0.10;

    // Determine transporter's home region
    Town town = TownyAPI.getInstance().getTown(transporter);
    Nation nation = town.getNation();

    // Withdraw insurance from transporter
    if (!vault.has(transporter, insurance)) {
        transporter.sendMessage("Insufficient funds for insurance!");
        return;
    }

    vault.withdrawPlayer(transporter, insurance);

    // Deposit to nation treasury
    if (nation != null) {
        nation.getAccount().deposit(insurance, "Silk Road Insurance");
    } else {
        // Fallback: town treasury or server sink
        town.getAccount().deposit(insurance, "Silk Road Insurance");
    }

    // Proceed with contract acceptance
    contract.transporter = transporter.getUniqueId();
    contract.state = ContractState.ACCEPTED;
    giveCargoItem(transporter, contract);
}
```

### Buyer/Shop Owner Protection

**No insurance needed** - fully protected by system:
- Buyer: Payment escrowed until delivery complete
- Shop Owner: Stock reserved, payment guaranteed on completion
- If contract fails: buyer refunded, stock released back to shop
- No risk of loss

---

## Transporter Progression System

### Transporter Levels

**Earning XP:**
- +10 XP per 100 blocks traveled with cargo
- +50 XP bonus per contract completed
- +100 XP bonus for high-value deliveries (>$1000 shop value)
- +25 XP bonus per region crossed

**Level Thresholds:**
```
Level 1 (Novice):      0 XP   - 1 contract at a time
Level 2 (Courier):   500 XP   - 2 contracts at a time
Level 3 (Trader):   1500 XP   - 3 contracts, access to high-value contracts (>$500)
Level 4 (Merchant): 3500 XP   - 4 contracts, 5% insurance discount
Level 5 (Caravan):  7000 XP   - 5 contracts, 10% insurance discount, priority on new contracts
```

**Level Benefits:**
1. **Multiple Contracts:** Carry multiple cargo items, efficient routes
2. **High-Value Access:** Prevent new players from abandoning expensive contracts
3. **Insurance Discount:** Reward experienced transporters
4. **Priority Access:** See new contracts before lower-level transporters

### Trust-Based Restrictions

```java
boolean canAcceptContract(Player transporter, Contract contract) {
    int level = getTransporterLevel(transporter);

    // Check active contracts limit
    int activeContracts = getActiveContracts(transporter).size();
    int maxContracts = level;  // Level 3 = 3 concurrent contracts
    if (activeContracts >= maxContracts) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check value restrictions
    double totalValue = contract.shopPrice * contract.quantity;
    if (level < 3 && totalValue > 500) {
        return false;  // High-value requires level 3+
    }

    return true;
}
```

---

## Cargo System

### Cargo Items

**Implementation:**
- Single inventory slot per contract (regardless of item quantity)
- Special item (BUNDLE or custom texture)
- Contains contract metadata (not actual items - virtual)
- Soulbound: Cannot drop, trade, store in chests, or lose on death

**Cargo Item Properties:**
```java
ItemStack createCargoItem(Contract contract) {
    ItemStack cargo = new ItemStack(Material.BUNDLE);
    ItemMeta meta = cargo.getItemMeta();

    meta.setDisplayName("¬ß6üì¶ Cargo: " + formatItemName(contract.item));
    meta.setLore(Arrays.asList(
        "¬ß7Quantity: ¬ßf" + contract.quantity,
        "¬ß7From: ¬ße" + contract.originRegion,
        "¬ß7To: ¬ße" + contract.destinationRegion,
        "¬ß7Current Bounty: ¬ßa$" + String.format("%.2f", contract.currentBounty),
        "",
        "¬ßcSoulbound - Cannot drop or trade",
        "¬ß7Right-click Trade Post to deliver"
    ));

    // Store contract ID in PDC
    meta.getPersistentDataContainer().set(
        new NamespacedKey(plugin, "contract_id"),
        PersistentDataType.STRING,
        contract.contractId.toString()
    );

    cargo.setItemMeta(meta);
    return cargo;
}
```

**Cargo Protection:**
- Block drop event (PlayerDropItemEvent)
- Block trade/give (InventoryClickEvent in other player's inventory)
- Block chest storage (InventoryMoveItemEvent)
- Persist through death (PlayerDeathEvent - keep cargo in inventory)
- Persist through logout (save contract state)

**Cargo Movement Effect:**
- Optional: Slowness I while carrying cargo (configurable)
- Makes journey feel weighty, adds challenge
- Can disable in config for fast-paced gameplay

## Economy Balancing

### Stormcraft Essence Farming Comparison

**Stormcraft Plugin:** Players earn "essence" by standing in the storm
- Assume rate: ~50 essence/minute in storm
- Conversion: 100 essence = $10 (example, adjust based on actual rates)
- Effective rate: ~$5/minute passively

**Silk Road Target:** Make transportation competitive

**Example Journey (competitive with AFK farming):**
- SafeZone ‚Üí Stormlands (800 blocks, ~10 minutes travel)
- Bounty: $370
- Insurance: $37
- Net earnings: $333
- Rate: $333 / 10 min = **$33.30/minute**

**Balancing Factors:**
- Transportation is active gameplay (not AFK)
- Requires initial capital (insurance)
- Has risk (time pressure, decay)
- Provides social/economic gameplay
- Should pay **2-5x** passive farming to incentivize

**Recommendation:** Adjust region rates to ensure:
```
Average transport earnings/min = 3x essence farming rate
```

If essence farming = $5/min:
- Target transport rate: $15/min (for medium journeys)
- Adjust `stormlands_rate`, `middle_rate`, `safe_rate` accordingly

### Money Flow

**Money Creation:**
- Transporter bounty: Created by server (inflation)
- Justification: Rewards active gameplay, drives economy

**Money Sinks:**
- Insurance payments: Go to nation treasuries (economic sink)
- Optional: Transaction tax on shop sales (separate from Silk Road)

**Shop Owner Revenue:**
- Normal shop prices (buyer pays)
- No change from regular BetterShop sales
- Silk Road expands market reach (more sales potential)

---

## Workflow Examples

### Example 1: Buyer Initiates (Direct Purchase)

1. **Player A** in Stormlands wants diamonds
2. Opens Trade Post, browses contracts
3. Sees BetterShop in SafeZone selling diamonds (Silk Road enabled)
4. Clicks "Purchase 2 diamonds for $1000"
5. Payment escrowed ($1000 withdrawn from Player A)
6. Contract created automatically:
   - Pickup: SafeZone shop
   - Delivery: Stormlands Trade Post
   - Bounty: $370 (calculated from distance + value)
7. Stock reserved in SafeZone shop (2 diamonds locked)
8. Contract posted to global job board

9. **Player B** (Level 3 Transporter) in Middle region browses jobs
10. Sees contract, clicks "Accept"
11. Pays $37 insurance to Middle nation treasury
12. Receives cargo item in inventory
13. Travels to SafeZone shop
14. Right-clicks shop chest with cargo item ‚Üí Picks up (virtual)
15. Travels to Stormlands (takes 12 minutes)
16. Arrives at Stormlands Trade Post
17. Right-clicks Trade Post with cargo item ‚Üí Delivers
18. Receives $370 bounty (net +$333 profit)
19. Shop owner receives $1000 (added to shop earnings)
20. Player A notified: "Your diamonds have arrived!"
21. Player A visits Trade Post, clicks "Pickup Orders", receives 2 diamonds

### Example 2: Shop Owner Sets Up Silk Road Shop

1. **Player C** in Stormlands creates BUY shop
2. `/shop create buy 500 --silkroad` (holding diamond)
3. Places shop chest, adds diamonds to stock
4. Shop is now visible in Trade Post GUIs across all regions

5. **Player D** in SafeZone sees shop in Trade Post GUI
6. Clicks "Purchase 1 diamond for $500"
7. Contract auto-created (same flow as Example 1)

8. **Alternate:** Local player buys from shop directly (before contract accepted)
   - Normal BetterShop transaction
   - Contract still available for remote buyers
   - First come, first served (local or Silk Road)

### Example 3: Contract Expires

1. **Player E** accepts contract (bounty: $200, insurance: $20)
2. Gets distracted, doesn't deliver in time
3. Bounty decays to $0 after 33 minutes
4. Contract auto-cancelled:
   - Cargo item removed from inventory
   - Stock reservation released in shop
   - Buyer refunded ($1000 returned)
   - Player E loses $20 insurance (gone to nation)
   - Contract re-posted as new job (if buyer still wants it)

## Anti-Abuse & Edge Cases

### Preventing Exploits

1. **Cargo Duplication:**
   - Cargo items stored with contract UUID in PDC
   - Contract can only be completed once
   - Cargo item deleted on delivery

2. **Insurance Fraud:**
   - Can't cancel contract and get insurance back
   - Can't "abandon" and reclaim insurance
   - Lost insurance goes to nation (not refundable)

3. **Stock Manipulation:**
   - Stock reserved atomically with contract creation
   - Shop owner can't remove reserved items
   - Can still sell other stock locally

4. **Multiple Pickups:**
   - Cargo pickup tracked per contract
   - Can only pick up once from shop
   - Subsequent attempts blocked

5. **Fake Deliveries:**
   - Delivery requires matching contract ID in cargo item
   - Can't deliver without picking up from shop first
   - Shop validates stock was actually reserved

### Edge Cases

**Shop Deleted While Contract Active:**
- Contract auto-cancelled
- Transporter refunded insurance
- Buyer refunded payment
- Cargo item removed

**Transporter Quits/Banned:**
- Contract expires naturally via decay
- Insurance already paid (sunk cost)
- Contract becomes available again

**Buyer Offline at Delivery:**
- Items stored in Trade Post "pending pickups"
- Safe until claimed (persisted to disk)
- Can claim anytime

**Region/Nation Deleted:**
- Existing contracts complete normally
- New contracts can't be created from/to that region
- Trade Posts in deleted regions disabled

**Server Crash During Delivery:**
- Contracts saved to disk every 30 seconds
- On restart: restore contract state
- Cargo items regenerated to transporter's inventory
- Stock reservations persist

### Dependencies

- **BetterShop** (soft dependency - enhance if present)
- **Vault** (hard dependency - economy)
- **Towny** or **Towns & Nations** (soft dependency - region detection)
- **Stormcraft** (soft dependency - balance reference)
- **PlaceholderAPI** (soft dependency - placeholders)

### Database/Storage

**Option 1: JSON Files (Simple)**
- `contracts.json` - Active contracts
- `transporters.json` - XP, levels, stats
- `tradeposts.json` - Trade post locations
- `history.json` - Completed contract history

**Option 2: SQLite (Scalable)**
- Better for large servers with many concurrent contracts
- Faster queries for contract browsing
- Transaction safety

**Recommendation:** Start with JSON, migrate to SQLite if needed

---

## Success Metrics

### Player Engagement
- Number of contracts completed per day
- Average transporter level across server
- Percentage of BetterShops with Silk Road enabled

### Economic Health
- Total bounty paid out vs. insurance collected (inflation tracking)
- Average contract bounty
- Contract completion rate (% not expired)

### Balance Indicators
- Average $/min for transporters vs. essence farming
- Contract acceptance time (how long before someone accepts)
- Region popularity (which routes are most common)

---

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core System (MVP)
- [ ] BetterShop integration (Silk Road toggle, stock reservation)
- [ ] Contract system (create, accept, deliver)
- [ ] Basic bounty calculation (distance + value)
- [ ] Cargo items (soulbound, single slot)
- [ ] Trade Posts (place, interact, GUI)
- [ ] Simple decay (fixed rate)
- [ ] Insurance system (pay to accept)

### Phase 2: Progression & Polish
- [ ] Adaptive decay (scale with distance)
- [ ] Transporter levels & XP
- [ ] Multiple concurrent contracts
- [ ] Insurance discounts
- [ ] Contract filtering/sorting in GUI
- [ ] Enhanced messaging & notifications

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- [ ] Towny integration (nation treasuries, region rates)
- [ ] Stormcraft balancing (compare to essence farming)
- [ ] Contract history & statistics
- [ ] Leaderboards
- [ ] Admin tools (view all contracts, force cancel, etc.)

### Phase 4: Expansion (Future)
- [ ] Random events
- [ ] Guilds/companies
- [ ] Express delivery
- [ ] Bulk shipping
- [ ] Route planning UI

## Open Questions

1. **Should buyers be able to cancel contracts?**
   - Pro: Gives buyers control if they change mind
   - Con: Wastes transporter time if accepted already
   - **Suggestion:** Allow cancel if not yet accepted; charge small fee if accepted

2. **Should there be a "tip" system?**
   - Buyers can add bonus to bounty to incentivize faster delivery
   - Creates dynamic pricing

3. **Should transporters see buyer/shop owner names?**
   - Anonymous contracts might reduce social pressure
   - Named contracts add community flavor

4. **How to handle multi-world servers?**
   - Limit Silk Road to specific worlds?
   - Calculate distance across worlds (Nether = 8x overworld)?

5. **Should there be NPC transporters (automated)?**
   - Fallback if no players accept contract
   - Much lower bounty, longer delivery time
   - Keeps economy moving but less interesting

---

## Conclusion

Silk Road creates a rich player-driven economy with:
- **Buyers:** Access to goods from any region
- **Shop Owners:** Expanded market reach, more sales
- **Transporters:** Profitable active gameplay, progression system
- **Server:** Dynamic economy, regional trade networks, emergent gameplay

The system is balanced to compete with passive farming (Stormcraft essence) while providing engaging, risk-reward gameplay that encourages exploration and regional interaction.
